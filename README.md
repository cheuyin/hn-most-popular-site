# HackerNews - What is the most popular site?

This is a Python program that answers a singular question born from random curiosity: what are the top 10 most popular websites on HackerNews?

## The Approach

1. Call the official HN API: https://github.com/HackerNews/API
2. Aggregate the top 100 posts going back 500 days, starting on Oct. 21, 2023
3. Make a top 10 list of websites that generated the most points 

## Hypothesis
Before I begin on this mini-project, I'm placing my bets that Wikipedia will be the most popular site.

## Results
TBD.
